Imageruler is a free Python program to compute minimum length scales of 1d or 2d design patterns given by topology optimization. The method for 2d cases is based on morphological transformations [1,2], which are realized by the OpenCV library [3].

The method for estimating the minimum length scale of solid regions in a 2d design pattern is outlined as follows.
1. Binarize the 2d array that represents the design pattern, so that each element is a Boolean value. Let $rho$ denote this binarized array. For ease of description, elements with values `True` and `False` are referred to as solid and void, respectively.
2. For a kernel given by a disc with the diameter $d$, compute morphological opening $\mathcal{O}_d(\rho)$ and obtain the difference $\mathcal{O}_d(\rho) \oplus \rho$, where $\oplus$ denotes exclusive or.
3. Evaluate whether $\mathcal{O}_d(\rho) \oplus \rho$ contains a solid pixel that overlaps an interior pixel of solid regions in $\rho$. If no, $d$ is less than the minimum length scale of solid regions; if yes, $d$ is not less than the minimum length scale of solid regions. Here the interior of solid regions in $\rho$ is given by morphological erosion using a small kernel like a cross with the size $3\times3$.
4. Use binary search and repeat Steps 2 and 3 to seek the minimum $d$ at which the answer in Step 3 is yes. This value of $d$ is considered as the minimum length scale of solid regions.

To estimate the minimum length scale of void regions in a 2d design pattern, the design pattern is inverted after binarization, i.e., $\rho \rightarrow \neg \rho$ so that solid and void regions are interchanged. Subsequent procedures are the same as described above. This approach is equivalent to computing $\mathcal{C}_d(\rho) \oplus \rho$ in Step 2 and test the overlap with interior pixels of void regions in $\rho$ in Step 3. Here $\mathcal{C}_d(\rho)$ denotes morphological closing.

The minimum length scale of $\rho$ is the minimum between the minimum length scales of solid and void regions. To obtain this minimum, one can compute the minimum length scales of solid and void regions separately and take the minimum. A more efficient approach is to compute $\mathcal{O}_d(\rho) \oplus \mathcal{C}_d(\rho)$ in Step 2 and test the overlap with the union of interior pixels of solid and void regions in $\rho$ in Step 3.

For 2d design patterns, finite resolution of discretization leads to inaccuracy. Typical errors of minimum length scales can be the size of a few pixels. Therefore, a design pattern with its minimum length scale much larger than the pixel size tends to result in a small relative error. In contrast, if the minimum length scale is comparable to the pixel size, the relative error may be large. Moreover, if a design pattern contains a sharp corner that is neither a small perturbation at the single-pixel level nor a portion of the edge of the design pattern, the minimum length scale should be zero or the size of one pixel, but the method gives a nonzero value that is proportional to but larger than the size of one pixel, if no smaller features coexist. In addition, implementation details can affect results.

For a 1d design pattern, the code simply searches for the minimum lengths among all solid or void segments.
